Hi, in this blog post, I hope to explore the performance of neural networks, particular autoencoders, in detecting anomalous bot matches
using the feature pipeline (if it can even be called such) I have published on my github. 

I want to differentiate the anomalous bot matches, henceforth called bot matches, from regular bot lobbies where players, ranging in numbers
from just one player to five, face five bots. The anomalous bot matches I refer to are the matches were five bots play against five bots
in a massed, coordinated fashion in order to seed the accounts of the bots with matches and MMR in order to prepare these accounts for selling.

Auto-encoders, as I will use them, might have difficulty in only determining anomalous bot matches. An anomalous match will be determined
as matches with a relatively large reconstruction error. Because of this nature, the matches that could be considered anomalous could include
matches with very large skill differences, matches with scripters or hackers, matches affected by poor network conditions or server shutdowns,
the original match intent of these bot matches, or other miscellaneous sorts of matches. 

Before diving into this matter, I am going to give a gentle introduction to autoencoders, mostly skipping over the math. Auto-encoders 
are neural networks that can be used to do dimensionality reduction, denoise, or, for our purpose, to determine a measure for anomalies.
